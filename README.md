A petition
Tara,
 Since I'm not a voter I Couldn’t sign a logical legal petition. Though in many situations when one does not have knowledge about the rules and regulations you at times slip through the cracks.
 I signed a petition for not allotting food imports into Iraq. The reasoning behind the choices being made were for producing a nonviolent atmosphere. I suppose as to oil with America and out trading amongst our neighbor country China… is to Iraq and food imports from America. Though It was a hit or miss situation yet it went smoothly.
 
 I'm for reducing bio chemicals in the air. And economic change for citizens living comfortable for the next hundred generations...Now that’s cool...I found a web site on the internet called (Green Party US), Their moving forward with a petition for taxing citizens for the use of amounts of carbons in the air operating machinery and other viable necessities. I wrote the website a comment...more like a short story and asked for guidance with supporting their wanting to amend the tax carbon petition. I've yet to receive an email. 
 Thanks, for your assistance as a redundant instructor whom teaching method seems for ones wanting of their education including a well-rounded within structure and rigorous strings.
